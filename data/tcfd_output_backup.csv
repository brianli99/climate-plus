Strategy,"To stress test our portfolio, AES identified third-party scenarios covering varying degrees of transition and physical risk."
Strategy,"While the scenarios may not be aligned with AES’ view of the future, our stress test uses the assumptions and outputs of third-party frameworks referenced by the TCFD as directly as possible so that investors can more easily compare companies."
Strategy,"Our effort was guided by a steering group consisting of members from our financial planning and analysis, corporate risk and strategy, sustainability, legal, operations and other teams."
Strategy,"Given our modest exposure to direct carbon risk and our pivot toward Clean Energy Growth Platforms, transition risk can enhance our upside potential."
Strategy,The stress test conclusion is that our corporate strategy is resilient across the three scenarios.
Metrics and Targets,"This target  is reflected in Aker BP’s planning assumptions, which show  an increase in both the EUA and national carbon tax over  the next 10 years, reaching the targeted level set by the Government for 2030."

Metrics and Targets,ATP has also chosen to calculate the equity portfolios' carbon footprint according to last year's method with the market cap as the allocation key to ensure transparency about the development from 2017 to 2018.
Metrics and Targets,The calculated carbon footprint of Nordic equities and international equities is very similar.
Risk Management,A forward-looking “Climate VaR”.
Risk Management,The Climate VaR per security is calculated for equities and corporate bonds to understand the impact that future costs and/or revenues might have on the current pricing of these securities.
Risk Management,The Climate VaR is the exact difference between the current market value of a security and the “new” present value after future climate change costs and/or revenues have been included into the DDM.
Risk Management,Default risk and spreads.
Risk Management,The Climate VaR therefore represents the percentage of a company’s market value that is poised to decrease or increase given the occurrence of climate change costs or revenues related to each scenario.
